\\ 	This is a simple Django blog site I made from scratch, with SQLite3 as the database engine.	//

We have the admin privileges activated with this blog, so the admin can log into the backend of the site and make add/edit posts for the blog. 

This is supposed to function as a template for a blog, with the graphics, content, and little odds and ends being created later and to any purpose.
